# Cryptography

Implementation of Simple Encryption.AES3 encryption and decryption

All 3 keys extraction from only one pair of <plain text, cipher text>

# How To Use

-e to encrypt
-d to decrypt
-b to break the algorithm

-e/-d -k <path to key> -i <path to input> -o <path to output>
-b -m <path to message> -c <path to cipher> -o <path to output>
