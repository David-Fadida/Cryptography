# Cryptography

Implementation of Simple Encryption.AES3 encryption and decryption

All 3 keys extraction from only one pair of <plain text, cipher text>

# How To Use

-e to encrypt
-d to decrypt
-b to break the algorithm

-e/-d -k path_to_key -i path_to_input -o path_to_output
-b -m path_to_message -c path_to_cipher -o path_to_output
